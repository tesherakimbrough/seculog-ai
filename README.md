## 🤖 AI-Powered Features (NEW)

SecuLog AI now integrates **AI and ML** to provide deeper insights into your security logs:

- **Semantic Search:**  
  Use natural language queries to search across logs using vector embeddings and AI-powered search.

- **LLM-Based Summarization:**  
  Automatically generate human-readable summaries of log activity, highlighting suspicious patterns and key events.

- **AI-Based Anomaly Detection:**  
  Detect unusual patterns in log data with advanced ML models (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders).

- **(Beta) RAG-Powered Security Q&A:**  
  Ask natural language security questions — AI combines your log data with cybersecurity knowledge to generate actionable answers.

These AI features make SecuLog AI a powerful tool for both professional security analysts and learners exploring AI + cybersecurity.

## ✨ AI-Powered Features

**Live Demo (Streamlit Cloud):**
- LLM-based Log Summarization 📝
- RAG-powered Security Q&A 🤖
- Interactive Visual Analytics 📈

**Available in Local Version:**
- Full Semantic Search using SentenceTransformers and vector search.

*Note: Due to Streamlit Cloud limitations, Semantic Search is available in the local version only.*

## 🛡️ How It Works

1. **Upload a log file** via the web interface.
2. **SecuLog AI parses and analyzes** the logs for “denied” events and brute-force attempts.
3. **Suspicious events are highlighted** (red for denied, blue for brute-force).
4. **Charts visualize** event types and top IPs.
